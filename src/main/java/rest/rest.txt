REST
1. What does REST stand for?
ANS: REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing distribute system.
     It is not a standard but a set of constraints, such as being stateless, having c/s relationship, and a uniform interface.
     Mostly, it is associated with HTTP.

2. What are safe REST operations?
ANS: GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS operations are safe, as they never change a resource, but only access it.

3. What are idempotent operations? Why is idempotency important?
ANS: GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS are idempotent operations;
     Idempotent operation produces same results if executed multiple times.
     They can have side effects, but the user doesn't expect them, so they can't be critical to the operation of the system.

4. Is REST scalable and/or interoperable?
ANS: REST is scalable and interoperable.

5. Is REST normally stateless?
ANS: ALL communication is stateless and session state is kept in the client side.
     States are represented in URIs and this improve scalability.
     REST also provides caching.

6. Is REST secure? What can you do to secure it?
ANS: By default, REST is not secure.
     We can configure security framework like Spring security for REST based URIs to secure HTTP request.

7. Does REST work with transport layer security (TLS)?
ANS: REST can work with transport layer security and SSL.

8. Which HTTP methods does REST use?
ANS: for CRUD: RequestMethod.POST, GET, PUT, DELETE;
     HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, TRACE

9. What is the HTTP status return code for a successful DELETE statement?
ANS: HTTP 204 No Content: the server processed the reuqest successfully, without returning any content.

10. Name some common http response codes. When do you need @ResponseStatus?
ANS: 1XX - informational
     2XX - success : 200 OK; 201 Created; 202 Accepted; 204 No Content;
     3XX - redirection: 308 Permanent Redirect;
     4XX - client error: 400 Bad request; 401 Unauthorized; 404 No Found; 408 Request Timeout
     5XX - server error
     use @ResponseState to apply on HTTP response, to override status infoset by other means.

11. Where do you need @EnableWebMVC?
ANS: we use @EnableWebMvc on Java configuration class to enable annotations like @RequestMapping, @ResponseBody.

12. Do you need Spring MVC in your classpath?
ANS: For using RestTemplate, you only need spring-web dependency.

13. What is an HttpMessageConverter?
ANS: HttpMessageConverter can convert different MediaType between Java object.
     like MarshalingHttpMessageConverter to read/write XML;
     MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter to read/write JSON;
     once use @EnableWebMvc, these converters are enabled by default.

14. Is @Controller a stereotype? Is @RestController a stereotype?
ANS: Both @Controller and @RestController are stereotype, used for denoting the roles of types or method
     in the overall architecture at conceptual level.

15. What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController?
ANS: @RestController will automatically add @ResponseBody to all method.

16. When do you need @ResponseBody?
ANS: use @ResponseBody to indicates the return of the method will be inside web response.

17. What are the advantages of the RestTemplate?
ANS: RestTemplate simplifies communication with HTTP servers by providing convenient Http request methods,
     internally using HttpMessageConverter to convert Http messages to Java objects, using customer exception handler.

18. What does CRUD mean?
ANS: CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete.
     For Http verbs, C - POST; R - GET; U - UPDATE, PATCH; D - DELETE.

19. What is a resource?
ANS: Resource is information, anything you want to supply.

20. What does @RequestMapping do?
ANS: @RequestMapping maps web requests onto specific handler classes or handler methods.

21. What does @PathVariable do?
ANS: @PathVariable annotates parameters for access URI template values.
